# pckt.conf: This is the configuration file for the pocket gopher daemon. Feel free to adjust
# all setting to your specific needs. Do not place quote marks around values; doing so would make
# pocket quite sad. Make sure to change the value of Conf_file in pocket or the daemon will use 
# its default settings, which probably isn't quite what you want. Happy Gophering.

#===General Settings===#

# Root Directory: This where your gopher files reside.
Root_dir = /var/gopher

# Server User: the user your server's process runs as after binding to a port. It's best to set
# this to an unprivleged user like 'nobody', 'www', or 'gopher'.
Server_user = nobody

# Log File: the file where your sever will record its logs to. Make sure that this file is writable 
# by your process' user or your log messages won't get recorded.
Log_file = /var/log/pdgd.log

# PID File: the file where you program will store its process ID number, which is useful for rc.d 
# scripts and the like.
Pid_file = /var/run/pdgd.pid

# Serve Index: the file where you can manage
Serve_index = /var/gopher/pdgd.index

# Gmap Extension: The file extension for gophermap files that serve as pseudo-directories.
Gmap_ext = gmap


#===Connection settings===#

# Host: the domain address that your server uses to interact with the world, i.e. 'mysite.com'
Host = localhost

# Port: port that your server will listen on. 70 is the standard port for Gopher and you probably
# shouldn't change it unless you have a compelling reason.
Port = 70

# Use IP version 6: if set to 'yes', pocket will communicate via IPv6, otherwise it defaults to 
# IPv4. If you're unsure which to use, leave IPv6 disabled.
Use_IPv6 = no

# Queue Length: this is the number of waiting connections your daemon will accept at one time.
# Setting this to a low number can serve as a primitive way to throttle the amount of simultaneous
# connections on an easily overwhelmed server, but will likely result in dropped connections
# on the client-side if too many people try to connect at once. It's better to use Max_fork
# to limit connections.
Q_len = 10

# Maximum Forks: this is the maximum number of child processes your daemon will fork at one
# time. Set this to a low number if you're running pocket on a system with limited resources.
# If the number of simultaneous connections exceeds Max_forks, pocket will bail excess connections
# more gracefully than limiting your queue length by notifying the client that the server is
# overloaded.
Max_forks = 5
	
#===General CGI options===#

# Enable CGI: set this to 'yes' if you want to run executable scripts on your gopher server.
# This setting only affects scripts that are not part of gophermap files.
Enable_CGI = yes

# Enable Gmap Scripts: set this to 'yes' if you want to run executable scripts from within
# gophermap files. This setting only affects scripts that are run from within gophermap files.
Enable_gmap_scripts = yes

# Prescrub Client Input: set this to 'yes' if you want to filter the input before it is passed
# along to a CGI script.
Prescrub_client_input = no

# Scrub Level: If client input prescrubbing is enabled, this sets the level of strictness the 
# scrubber will use. The levels are 'paranoid' which removes all characters except alphanumeric
# characters and spaces, 'strict' which removes the following characters: '[]()!&?$+=-\/;`{}^<>*|~'
# and any control characters, and 'gentle' which removes: '[]/\;`{}^<>*|~' and any control 
# characters.
Scrub_level = gentle

#===Personal Gopherspace options===#

# Enable User gophers: allow users on your system to have personal Gopher spaces.
Enable_user_gophers = yes

# User Gopher Directory: The name of the directory in which users keep their Gopher files.
User_gopher_dir = public_gopher

# This is the path leading up to each user's home directory. On most systems this is '/home'.
# On Mac OS X, it is '/Users/'.
Path_to_user_home = /home

# User Prefix: the prefix in the URL that indicates a request for a user's directory. If
# User_prefix is 'personal' the url to a user's space would be be 
# gopher://yoursite.org/1/personal/~username
User_prefix = personal

# Enable User CGI: set this to 'yes' to allow users to run executable scripts otherwise,
# pocket defaults to 'no'.
Enable_user_CGI = no

# Enable User Gmap Scripts: set this to 'yes' to allow users to run executable scripts from
# in their gophermaps. As with the main settings for enabling CGI and executables in gophermaps,
# enabling normal CGI is independent from enabling script execution in gophermaps.
Enable_user_gmap_scripts = no
